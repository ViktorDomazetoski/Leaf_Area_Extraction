# Leaf Area Extraction

## Overview
The script allows for the automatized extraction of leaves from digital scans and for the consequent calculation of leaf area, height and width, as well as the area of any holes in leaves. 

## Installation
The code is available as a jupyter notebook. The easiest way to run the notebook is through a local installation of Python through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and installing additional required packages (as labeled in the requirements.txt file) using the python package manager [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).


## Usage 
Example usage of the code is contained in the notebook. Users need to provide a list of paths to the images and can customize the result of the function based on their needs such as: set the smallest leaf size, resize the image resolution,whether to visualize and save the extracted leaf images.
